// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Ask for numbers 1 through 10
If the numbers are 1,3,5,7,9 then they are odd
If numbers are 2,4,6,8,10 then they are even)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Read num 5
 Read num 10
 Read num 15 
 Read num 20
 Read num 25
 Add all num together to = sum
 Divide sum by 5 = avg=15)
 Num 5= minimum number
 Num 25= maximum number
